# Swift-Practice
### Overview

This repository is dedicated to learning Swift. It contains notes, experiments, and implementations of algorithms that I have created as part of my daily programming practice. The goal of this repository is to track my progress and share my knowledge with others who are also learning Swift.

Feel free to use the contents of this repository as a reference or learning resource. Please note that some portions of the code and notes may have been sourced from various blogs, professors, and Stack Overflow, and I cannot claim that all work is entirely my own. 

### About Me
I am a student and I am trying to master these languages on my own. I try to dedicate at least one hour each day to practicing and improvement. I am currently focusing on Swift, Python and Rust as part of my daily programming study plan.
